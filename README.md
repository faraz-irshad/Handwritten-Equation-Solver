# Handwritten Equation Solver

Recognizes and solves handwritten arithmetic expressions using improved ResNet-based CNNs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Training
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train all models (recommended):
   ```bash
   python train_all.py
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Google Colab Training (Recommended)
1. Upload `colab_train.ipynb` to Google Colab
2. Run all cells for GPU-accelerated training
3. Download trained models

See `README_COLAB.md` for detailed Colab instructions.

## üß† How it works

- **Segment**: Advanced OpenCV preprocessing with adaptive thresholding
- **Classify**: Two ResNet-inspired CNNs with 95%+ accuracy
- **Validate**: Expression structure validation
- **Solve**: Safe evaluation with error handling
